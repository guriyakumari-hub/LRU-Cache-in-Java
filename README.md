🧠 LRU Cache Implementation in Java
This project implements an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache in Java using a custom Doubly Linked List and a HashMap for efficient O(1) access and update operations.

🔍 What is an LRU Cache?
An LRU Cache discards the least recently used items first when the cache reaches its limit. It is often used in memory management systems to ensure the most relevant or recently accessed data stays available.

📂 Features
✅ O(1) time complexity for getValue and insertKeyValue operations
✅ Uses HashMap for O(1) key lookup
✅ Custom Doubly Linked List with prev and next pointers
✅ Dummy head and tail nodes to eliminate edge case null checks
✅ Handles cache eviction automatically when capacity is full
✅ Tracks the most recently used item
🧱 Implementation Details
Custom Node class stores the key, value, and prev/next pointers for doubly linked list traversal.
HashMap<String, Node> provides O(1) direct access to any node.
Dummy head node always points to the most recently used item.
Dummy tail node always points just after the least recently used item.
removeNode() — detaches a node from its current position in O(1).
addToFront() — inserts a node right after head (most recent position) in O(1).
If a key is accessed or updated, it is moved to the front of the list.
If capacity is full, the node just before tail (LRU item) is evicted.
🚀 Usage
LRUCache lru = new LRUCache(3);          // Create LRU Cache with capacity 3
lru.insertKeyValue("mango", 10);         // Insert key-value pairs
lru.insertKeyValue("apple", 20);
lru.insertKeyValue("banana", 30);
System.out.println(lru.mostRecentKey()); // Outputs: banana

lru.insertKeyValue("mango", 40);         // Update mango — moves to front
System.out.println(lru.mostRecentKey()); // Outputs: mango

Integer val = lru.getValue("mango");     // Access mango (most recent)
if (val != null) {
    System.out.println("Order of Mango " + val); // 40
}

lru.insertKeyValue("guava", 20);         // Evicts least recently used item

if (lru.getValue("apple") == null) {
    System.out.println("apple doesn't exist");
}
🧠 Doubly Linked List Structure
[HEAD] <-> [most recent] <-> [...] <-> [least recent] <-> [TAIL]
Insertions and updates always go next to HEAD
Evictions always happen from next to TAIL
prev and next pointers allow O(1) removal from any position
🛠️ Requirements
Java 8 or higher
Any standard Java compiler (javac / IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code)
💻 How to Run
javac LRUCache.java
java LRUCache
📌 Example Output
banana
mango
Order of Mango 40
apple doesn't exist
